1. Collect 6 monts worth of 1-second XRP mid-price data
    - in UTC
    - store in 24hour CSVs
2. Train my 1-Hour remaning HAR model on XRP
3. Collect Polymarket Prices with my Private Model Predictions 
4. Analyze the results to determine if I can trade this strategy
5. If yes, build an algorthmic trading system for this strategy
    - does not need to be scalable
    - i need to move fast, since these markets will get more competitive 

Goal: Get this all done in a week

NOTE: I should also collect polymarket data for the first 10min
before the start of the hour (70min window). This will allow me
to see if there is any emperical evidence for my wiggle strategy. 
Capture small price divergence in "pre-market" by buying the 
cheaper side, and buying the complement in the first 10min
in theory capturing the spread. 

PRE MARKET WIGGLE CAPTURE
